                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The rules for the modern casino version of the game are attributed to a dice maker named 
                    John H. Winn, who proposed a standardized set of rules for the game 
                    in 1907 (“Winn’s Rules”) and a standardized table top layout. To see an 
                    example of a casino craps table layout and a brief explanation of the casino rules, 
                    take a look at this site: <a href="https://www.bestuscasinos.org/blog/how-the-craps-table-works-for-beginners/" target="_blank">
                    How the Craps Table Works (For Beginners)</a>.
                    These rules and table layout were quickly adopted by casinos and remain the standards for the game today.
                </p>
                <p>This project is written in Java language and simulate the Craps Game with rules like the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The person with the dice is 'the shooter'. The shooter decides how much
                        they want to bet, which is called 'the action'.</li>
                    <li>The shooter has to make a minimum bet of 10 dollars, and the bet amount must be
                        a multiple of $10, but they can bet up to the maximum amount in their bank roll.</li>
                    <li>The other players are invited to 'take a piece of the action', which means
                        they can bet an amount up to but not greater than the amount of the action.
                        For example, if the 'action amount' bet was $50, then one player could 'take
                        $30 of the action, a second player could 'take $10 of the action, and a third
                        player could take the final $10 of the action.The action of $50 would then be
                        'covered' and no other players in the game would be able to lay a bet on this
                        round.When all bets are placed, the shooter rolls the dice on the 'come out'
                        roll. Here are the possible outcomes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IF the shooter rolls a seven or eleven, then they have rolled 'a natural' and
                                they win their bet. The bets of the otherplayers will be given to the shooter.
                            </li>
                            <li>IF the shooter rolls a two ('snake-eyes), a three ('ace-deuce'), or a twelve
                                ('box-cars')then the shooter 'craps out' (loses) and the amount of his action is 
                                split up and given to the other players according to the amount they bet.
                            </li>
                            <li>IF the shooter rolls any other number besides 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, then that number
                                becomes the shooter's point. The shooter now rolls the dice again until they either
                                roll their point again, in which case they have 'come' and won the pass, or they roll
                                a seven,in which case they 'don't come' (lose) because they have 'sevened out'.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>After a pass is completed, the shooter may choose to continue to roll the dice 
                        ('make another pass') or they can pass the dice to the next player ('pass on the bones').
                    </li>
                    <li>If a player loses all of their money, they are out of the game ('cleaned out').
                        The game ends when one player has won all of the money in the game from the other
                        players ('cleaned house').
                    </li>
                </ol>
